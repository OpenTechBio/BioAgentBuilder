Data often present unique challenges: high dropout for lowly expressed genes (especially in neurons) and potential stress signatures from dissociation. In spatial transcriptomics, layer-specific localization in the cortex, hippocampus, or other distinct brain regions is important. During analysis, interpret clusters within known anatomic references or using reference atlases (e.g., Allen Brain Atlas). Ensure to consider marker genes relevant to cell subtypes like Gad1, Gad2 (for inhibitory neurons), Slc17a7, Slc17a6 (excitatory neuron markers), Aqp4, Aldh1l1 (astrocytes), Mbp, Mog (oligodendrocytes), and C1qa, P2ry12 (microglia)."

Spatial analyses may reveal distinct tumor-immune niches or infiltration gradients. Summaries should highlight differences in gene expression patterns between malignant and normal cells, focusing on known oncogenic pathways (e.g., p53, Ras, Myc) and targeted therapy possibilities.

Dimensionality Reduction: PCA to reduce noise, UMAP or t-SNE for visualization.\n6. Clustering: Graph-based methods (leiden or louvain) for cell type grouping.\n7.
